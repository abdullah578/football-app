# Football App

This app uses the typical webstack (HTML, CSS, and JS) and the MVC (Model View Controller) architecture in conjuction with API-Football to display league standings and fixtures. It is also capable of displaying a specific team's stats and fixtures and can filter out fixtures that don't include a user-entered team in the fixture.
